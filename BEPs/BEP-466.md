## Abstract

[EIP-7685](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7685.md) adds `requests_hash` to the block header. To achieve compatibility, this element must be defined in BNB Smart Chain (BSC).

## Motivation

The goal is to make the block header format compatible with EIP-7685. This allows for shared codebases and APIs between implementations, promoting consistency and interoperability.

## Specification

### Block Header

In line with EIP-7685, the header is extended with a new 32-byte commitment value, `requests_hash`. On BSC:

1. Collecting `requests` or validating their correspondence with `requests_hash` is not required.
2. After the Prague hard fork, `requests_hash` must not be nil to ensure compatibility with EIP-7685.
3. Include `requests_hash` in the computation when calculating the header signature.
